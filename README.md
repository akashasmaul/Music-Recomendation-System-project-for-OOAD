# Music-Recomendation-System-project-for-OOAD

Recommendation systems are software tools and techniques providing suggestions for items to be of use to a user. In our project, we discussed the idea of a Music Recommendation System, where the purpose is to help users find kinds of music sequentially according to their choice. Here, we have shown how a Music Recommendation System works. We have developed this application as an interface among the Users, Artists, and Administration.
